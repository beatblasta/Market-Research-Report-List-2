<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflow Soldering Oven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Convection Ovens</li><li>Vapour Phase Ovens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reflow soldering ovens are classified into two main types: convection ovens and vapour phase ovens. Convection ovens use forced hot air to heat the components and solder paste, ensuring uniform heating throughout the assembly. On the other hand, vapour phase ovens utilize a special liquid with a lower boiling point than solder paste to create a vapour that evenly heats the components. Both types of ovens are used in the electronics industry for soldering components onto circuit boards with precision and reliability.</p></p>
