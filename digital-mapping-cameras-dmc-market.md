<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Mapping Cameras (DMC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Array Scanners (Pushbroom)</li><li>Area Arrays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital Mapping Cameras (DMC) are used to capture high-resolution images for mapping and surveying purposes. Linear Array Scanners, also known as Pushbroom cameras, capture images by scanning a strip of pixels across the ground as the aircraft moves forward. Area Arrays capture images in a single snapshot using a grid of pixels. Linear Array Scanners are more commonly used for large-scale mapping projects, while Area Arrays are better suited for smaller-scale projects that require high-resolution details. Both types of cameras play a crucial role in modern mapping technologies.</p></p>
