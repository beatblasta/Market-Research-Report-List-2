<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DNA Testing</li><li>Blood Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Noninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) includes two main types of testing: DNA Testing and Blood Testing. DNA Testing involves analyzing the cell-free fetal DNA circulating in the mother's bloodstream to screen for chromosomal abnormalities. On the other hand, Blood Testing measures various biomarkers in the mother's blood to assess the risk of certain genetic disorders in the fetus. Both types of testing are noninvasive and offer a safer alternative to traditional invasive prenatal testing methods like amniocentesis.</p></p>
