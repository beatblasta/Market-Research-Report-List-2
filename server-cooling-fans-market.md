<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial fans and centrifugal fans are two main types in the server cooling fans market. Axial fans work by creating airflow parallel to the fan's axis, while centrifugal fans create airflow perpendicular to the fan's axis. Axial fans are better suited for applications requiring high airflow at low pressures, while centrifugal fans are better for high-pressure applications. Both types are commonly used in server cooling systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures and prevent overheating. The choice between axial and centrifugal fans depends on the specific cooling needs of the server system.</p></p>
