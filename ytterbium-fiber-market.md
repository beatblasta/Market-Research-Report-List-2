<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ytterbium Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Clad Fiber</li><li>Double-Clad Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ytterbium fiber is used in two main types: Single-Clad Fiber and Double-Clad Fiber. Single-Clad Fiber has a single ytterbium-doped core surrounded by a cladding material. This design is simpler and more cost-effective, suitable for applications where high power is not required. Double-Clad Fiber, on the other hand, has both an inner core and an outer cladding layer doped with ytterbium. This design allows for higher power handling capabilities, making it ideal for industrial and high-power laser applications.</p></p>
