<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radical Initiator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Molecules</li><li>Azo Compounds</li><li>Peroxides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radical initiators are commonly used in polymerization processes to start the formation of polymer chains. There are three main types of radical initiators: halogen molecules, azo compounds, and peroxides. Halogen molecules, such as bromine or chlorine, undergo homolytic cleavage to produce radicals. Azo compounds, like azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), also decompose into radicals when heated. Peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxide, generate radicals through thermal or chemical decomposition. Each type of radical initiator has its own advantages and applications in various industries.</p></p>
