<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diffuse Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Diffuse Sensors</li><li>Background Suppression Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diffuse sensors are a type of proximity sensor that detect objects within a certain range without the need for a reflector or separate receiver. Ordinary diffuse sensors detect objects based on the reflection of light off the object's surface. Background suppression sensors, on the other hand, are more advanced and can accurately detect objects even in the presence of background clutter or varying surface colors. They use a light beam that is emitted at a specific angle to filter out background interference.</p></p>
