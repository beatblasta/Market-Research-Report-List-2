<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primary Antibodies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyclonal</li><li>Monoclonal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Primary antibodies are key reagents in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. The primary antibody market can be broadly classified into two types based on their source and specificity - polycolonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies are produced by different B cell clones and recognize multiple epitopes on an antigen, providing high sensitivity but potentially lower specificity. Monoclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are produced by a single B cell clone and recognize a single epitope, offering higher specificity but possibly lower sensitivity. Both types play crucial roles in various scientific disciplines.</p></p>
