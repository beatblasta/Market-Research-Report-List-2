<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Fieldmeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contacting</li><li>Contacting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electrostatic Fieldmeter market can be classified into two types: Non-Contacting and Contacting. Non-contacting fieldmeters detect and measure electrostatic fields without physically touching the object being measured, making them ideal for delicate or hard-to-reach surfaces. Contacting fieldmeters, on the other hand, require direct contact with the surface to measure the electrostatic field. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industries such as electronics manufacturing, healthcare, and automotive for static electricity measurement and control.</p></p>
