<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Earth Resistivity Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Channel</li><li>Multi Channel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Earth resistivity meters can be categorized into two main types: single channel and multi-channel. Single channel earth resistivity meters have only one channel for measuring resistivity, making them suitable for simple and small-scale applications. On the other hand, multi-channel earth resistivity meters have multiple channels, allowing for simultaneous measurement at different locations or depths. This makes them ideal for more complex and large-scale projects that require extensive data collection. Both types of meters are essential tools for geophysical surveys and subsurface exploration.</p></p>
