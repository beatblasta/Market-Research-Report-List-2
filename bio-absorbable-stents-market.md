<p><h1>Bio-absorbable Stents Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Bio-absorbable Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Bio-absorbable stents are medical devices used to treat coronary artery disease. Unlike traditional stents made of metal, bio-absorbable stents gradually dissolve in the body over time, reducing the risk of long-term complications such as restenosis or thrombosis. These stents are made from materials that are metabolized and eventually absorbed by the body, leaving behind healed blood vessels.</p><p>The Bio-absorbable Stents Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, advancements in bio-absorbable stent technology, and growing preference for minimally invasive procedures are driving the market growth. Additionally, the rising geriatric population and the growing adoption of bio-absorbable stents in emerging markets are also contributing to the market expansion.</p><p>The latest trends in the Bio-absorbable Stents Market include the development of next-generation bio-absorbable stents with improved biocompatibility and efficacy, collaborations between medical device companies and research institutions to enhance product offerings, and increasing investment in research and development activities to introduce innovative stent technologies. These trends are expected to propel the growth of the Bio-absorbable Stents Market in the coming years.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-absorbable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metallic Stents</li><li>Polymeric Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio-absorbable stents are a type of medical device used to treat coronary artery disease by providing support to keep the artery open. There are two main types of bio-absorbable stents: metallic stents and polymeric stents. Metallic stents are made of materials like magnesium or iron that gradually dissolve in the body over time. Polymeric stents are made of biodegradable polymers that break down and are absorbed by the body. Both types of stents offer the advantage of not requiring long-term presence in the body like traditional stents.</p></p>
