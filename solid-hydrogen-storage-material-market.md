<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solid Hydrogen Storage Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Adsorption Hydrogen Storage</li><li>Chemical Hydrogen Storage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Physical adsorption hydrogen storage involves storing hydrogen molecules on the surface of a solid material through weak van der Waals forces. This type of storage is typically reversible and does not alter the chemical structure of the material. Chemical hydrogen storage, on the other hand, involves chemically binding hydrogen atoms within the material's crystal lattice or as part of a chemical compound. This method usually requires higher temperatures or pressures for hydrogen release and may involve more complex material synthesis. Both types offer potential solutions for efficient and safe hydrogen storage.</p></p>
